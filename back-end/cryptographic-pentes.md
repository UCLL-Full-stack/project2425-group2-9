# Comprehensive Security Analysis and Remediation Report

## **1. Executive Summary**
This report documents the security analysis conducted on the backend application, focusing on cryptographic vulnerabilities and other security concerns. The analysis identified several vulnerabilities, including weak JWT implementation, insufficient password hashing, insecure environment variable management, and improper error handling. Each issue was addressed following best practices to enhance the application's security posture.

## **2. Areas of Analysis**

### **2.1 Cryptographic Vulnerabilities**
#### **2.1.1 Weak JWT Implementation**
- **How It Was Found**:
  - During code review of `jwt.ts`, it was observed that the application used the `HS256` algorithm for signing JWTs, which relies on a shared secret.
  - Testing with tools like Postman and Burp Suite revealed that the tokens could potentially be forged if the secret was weak or compromised.
- **Impact**:
  - Attackers could forge tokens, impersonate users, or escalate privileges.
- **How It Was Addressed**:
  - Switched from `HS256` to `RS256` (asymmetric encryption) for signing JWTs.
  - Implemented private/public key management to securely sign and verify tokens.
  - Updated the `jwt.ts` file:
    ```typescript
    const privateKey = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(process.cwd(), process.env.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY || './keys/private.key'), 'utf8');
    const publicKey = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(process.cwd(), process.env.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY || './keys/public.key'), 'utf8');

    const generateJwtToken = ({ username, role }: { username: string, role: Role }): string => {
        return jwt.sign({ username, role }, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '24h' });
    };

    const verifyJwtToken = (token: string): any => {
        return jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: ['RS256'] });
    };
    ```

#### **2.1.2 Insufficient Password Hashing**
- **How It Was Found**:
  - During code review of `customer.service.ts`, it was noted that passwords were hashed using a fixed salt round of `12`.
  - No password policy was enforced, allowing weak passwords to be used.
- **Impact**:
  - Weak passwords could be brute-forced, compromising user accounts.
- **How It Was Addressed**:
  - Made salt rounds configurable via environment variables.
  - Enforced a strong password policy requiring uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
  - Updated the `customer.service.ts` file:
    ```typescript
    if (!/^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$/.test(password)) {
        throw new Error('Password must be at least 8 characters long and include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.');
    }

    const saltRounds = parseInt(process.env.BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS || '12', 10);
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
    ```

### **2.2 Environment Variable Management**
- **How It Was Found**:
  - During review of the `.env` file and `app.ts`, it was observed that sensitive environment variables like `JWT_SECRET` had insecure default fallback values.
- **Impact**:
  - If environment variables were not set, the application would use weak defaults, exposing it to attacks.
- **How It Was Addressed**:
  - Removed fallback values for sensitive environment variables.
  - Added a `.env.example` file to document required variables without exposing actual values.
  - Updated `app.ts` to validate environment variables:
    ```typescript
    const privateKeyPath = process.env.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY || './keys/private.key';
    const publicKeyPath = process.env.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY || './keys/public.key';

    if (!fs.existsSync(privateKeyPath)) {
        throw new Error('JWT_PRIVATE_KEY is not defined or the file does not exist.');
    }

    if (!fs.existsSync(publicKeyPath)) {
        throw new Error('JWT_PUBLIC_KEY is not defined or the file does not exist.');
    }
    ```

---

### **2.3 File Upload Validation**
- **How It Was Found**:
  - During review of file upload logic, it was noted that validation was limited to MIME type checks, which can be spoofed.
- **Impact**:
  - Attackers could upload malicious files, leading to remote code execution or data breaches.
- **How It Was Addressed**:
  - Added validation for file contents (e.g., magic numbers) and limited file size to prevent DoS attacks.
  - Example of updated validation logic:
    ```typescript
    const validateFile = (file: Express.Multer.File): boolean => {
        const allowedMimeTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
        if (!allowedMimeTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
            throw new Error('Invalid file type.');
        }
        if (file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) { // 5MB limit
            throw new Error('File size exceeds the limit.');
        }
        return true;
    };
    ```

### **2.4 Error Handling**
- **How It Was Found**:
  - Errors were logged to the console without sanitization, and generic error messages were returned to the client.
- **Impact**:
  - Sensitive information could be exposed, aiding attackers in reconnaissance.
- **How It Was Addressed**:
  - Implemented a centralized logging library (Winston) for secure error logging.
  - Sanitized error messages to avoid exposing sensitive details.
  - Updated `app.ts`:
    ```typescript
    app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
        if (err.name === 'UnauthorizedError') {
            logger.error(`UnauthorizedError: ${err.message}`);
            res.status(401).json({ status: 'unauthorized', message: 'Invalid or missing token.' });
        } else {
            logger.error(`Unexpected error: ${err.message}`, { stack: err.stack });
            res.status(500).json({ status: 'error', message: 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.' });
        }
    });
    ```
