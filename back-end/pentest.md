---

## 3. Vulnerabilities Discovered

### 3.1 Weak JWT Implementation
- **Description**: The application uses the `HS256` algorithm for JWT signing, which relies on a shared secret. If the secret is weak or compromised, tokens can be forged.
- **Impact**: Attackers can impersonate users or escalate privileges.
- **CVE Reference**: [CVE-2023-31122](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-31122)
- **Affected Code**: [Insert Code Snippet or File Path]
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Use `RS256` (asymmetric encryption) instead of `HS256`.
  2. Validate the strength of the secret key during application startup.
  3. Rotate keys periodically.

---

### 3.2 Insufficient Password Hashing
- **Description**: Passwords are hashed using a fixed salt round of `12`, and no password policy is enforced.
- **Impact**: Weak passwords can be brute-forced, compromising user accounts.
- **Affected Code**: [Insert Code Snippet or File Path]
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Use a configurable salt round (e.g., via environment variables).
  2. Enforce a strong password policy (minimum length, special characters, etc.).

---

### 3.3 Default Fallback for Environment Variables
- **Description**: Sensitive environment variables like `JWT_SECRET` have insecure default fallback values.
- **Impact**: If environment variables are not set, the application uses weak defaults, exposing it to attacks.
- **Affected Code**: [Insert Code Snippet or File Path]
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Remove fallback values for sensitive environment variables.
  2. Use a `.env.example` file to document required variables without exposing actual values.

---

### 3.4 Insecure File Upload Validation
- **Description**: File uploads are validated only by MIME type, which can be spoofed.
- **Impact**: Attackers can upload malicious files, leading to remote code execution or data breaches.
- **CVE Reference**: [CVE-2021-27290](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27290)
- **Affected Code**: [Insert Code Snippet or File Path]
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Validate file contents (e.g., magic numbers) in addition to MIME type.
  2. Limit file size to prevent DoS attacks.

---

### 3.5 Information Leakage in Error Handling
- **Description**: Errors are logged to the console without sanitization, and generic error messages are returned to the client.
- **Impact**: Sensitive information may be exposed, aiding attackers in reconnaissance.
- **Affected Code**: [Insert Code Snippet or File Path]
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Use a centralized logging library (e.g., Winston) to log errors securely.
  2. Avoid exposing sensitive details in error messages returned to the client.

## 4. Risk Assessment

| Vulnerability                     | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|-----------------------------------|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| Weak JWT Implementation           | High     | High       | High   | Critical   |
| Insufficient Password Hashing     | Medium   | Medium     | High   | High       |
| Default Fallback for Env Variables| Medium   | Medium     | Medium | Medium     |
| Insecure File Upload Validation   | High     | High       | High   | Critical   |
| Information Leakage in Error Logs | Low      | Medium     | Medium | Medium     |

---

## 5. Recommendations

### Cryptographic Improvements:
1. Switch to `RS256` for JWT signing.
2. Enforce strong secrets and rotate keys periodically.

### Password Security:
1. Implement a strong password policy.
2. Use dynamic salt rounds for hashing.

### Environment Variable Management:
1. Remove insecure fallback values.
2. Secure `.env` files and exclude them from version control.

### File Upload Security:
1. Validate file contents and limit file size.

### Error Handling:
1. Use a secure logging library.
2. Return generic error messages to clients.

---

## 6. Tools Used
- **Static Code Analysis**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit
- **Manual Testing**: Postman
- **Logging**: Winston (recommended for implementation)

---

## 7. Conclusion
The penetration test revealed several critical vulnerabilities, particularly in cryptographic practices and file upload validation. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance the security posture of the application.
